# misc
Tanken är att utan ticket blir du inte insläppt så det handlar mer om automatiserad/rättvis köhantering vilket i sin tur medför att fysisk köbildning inte behövs => mindre trängsel.
Med en reggad ticket/tid så optimerar man också tidsåtgång/minskar social exponering då man (förhoppningsvis) endast beger sig till systembolaget när man har sin allokerade timeslot.
Från FHM's anvisningar idag.
Butiker, köpcentrum och gallerior bör begränsa antalet kunder som vistas i lokalen samtidigt. De bör också ta fram alternativa lösningar till kassaköer eller anvisa hur långt kunderna kan stå mellan varandra.

# Short pitch
Replace old queueing system where people have to wait in line or stay within close vincinity in order to see the current
number being processed. 

We propose a fully digital solution which is not dependant on registration processes, special hardware or the sharing of personal data.

This idea helps save lives by making physical distancing easier for situations where queues are necessary.  

# Problem description
In order to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus physical distancing rules are now suggested, mandatory and even enforced in many places. What can we do to minimize the physical contact and therefore help saving lives in situations where physical queues and waiting in line previously was the norm?

# Solution description
We propose a fully digital solution which is not dependant on complex registration processes, exotic hardware or the sharing of personal data. It aims to replace the "old" way of getting a paper ticket and collectively waiting in the vincinity of a display where the current/next ticket being processed are displayed. 

A store representative:
1. Registers the site/facility by supplying:
 - A description together with an optional logo, for ex. "Systembolaget"
2. Gets automaticall assigned a unique site-identifier in the form of a QR-code.
- This is what identifies the site and should be kept. If it is lost the site needs to redo the registration (not a big deal since it's so easy anyway).
3. Registers one or more virtual queues with the site by supplying:
- A description for the queue, for ex. "Huvudkön"
4. Gets back a unique identifier in the form of a QR code for each queue.
- The QR code is what the customers scan in order to get a virtual ticket for the queue.
5. Can see realtime information about the queue and manage it:
- Sees total estimated waiting time for the queue.
- Number of people currently in the queue.
- The current ticket number being handled.
- Function to advance the queue.

A customer arrives at a site for which he/she wan't to be admitted:
1. Scans the QR code which the site representatives have made available in some way.
2. Enters the queue and gets assigned a virtual ticket.
3. The customer can see the estimated time left before admission, and can therefore choose to wait somewhere else in order to minimize contact with others.
4. When the estimated queue time gets closer to zero the customer moves towards the admission point.
5. Waits in the vincinity until his/her own ticket number comes up on a screen or is called out in some way.
6. Shows the virtual ticket to the admission representative and gets admitted.
- When admitting a person the admission representative advances the queue through their admin interface.
